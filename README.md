# salary-prediction
Overview
This project involves creating a web-based Salary Prediction Application using machine learning. The app uses Flask for backend development and integrates a responsive frontend for user interaction. Based on user inputs like experience, education level, and skills, the application predicts the expected salary using a trained machine learning model.

Features
Machine Learning Model:

Predicts salaries based on various features such as years of experience, job role, education, and location.
Trained using regression techniques with high accuracy.
Frontend:

User-friendly interface for data input.
Displays predicted salary dynamically after submission.
Backend:

Flask-based API for handling requests and delivering predictions.
Robust and scalable architecture for integration with other services.
Technologies Used
Python: For model development and backend logic.
Libraries:
Pandas, Numpy: Data preprocessing and manipulation.
Scikit-learn: Model training and evaluation.
Flask: Backend development.
Frontend:
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap: For a responsive and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: For dynamic interactions.
Workflow
Data Collection:

Dataset of salaries based on job roles, experience, education, and location, sourced from platforms like Kaggle or LinkedIn datasets.
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical features (e.g., job roles, education level).
Feature scaling and normalization.
Model Development:

Training regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, or Random Forest Regressor.
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Saving the best-performing model using joblib or pickle.
Frontend Development:

Building an HTML form for user inputs.
Styling the page using CSS and Bootstrap for responsiveness.
Backend Development:

Flask app to handle data processing and predictions.
REST API endpoint for real-time salary predictions.
